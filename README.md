# Bank-Account-Simulation
This repository contains a Java-based project that simulates basic bank account operations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to simulate core functionalities of a bank account, including deposits, withdrawals, 
and maintaining transaction history, all implemented using Java OOP concepts.

Tools Used:
Java: The core programming language for the application.
Eclipse IdE for Enterprise Java Development Environment (IDE) used for development.
Terminal: Used for compiling and running the Java program.

Deliverables:
The main deliverable of this project is a class-based Java program designed to handle bank account transactions and management.

Hints/Mini Guide for Implementation:
Account Class Implementation: Develop an Account class that encapsulates account-related data and methods.
This class should include methods for deposit() and withdraw() operations.
State Management: Ensure the Account class effectively maintains the current account balance and a comprehensive transaction history for each account.
